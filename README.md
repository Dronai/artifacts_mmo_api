# Artifacts MMO API

This is my very first package.

Artifacts MMO is an API-based game.
You can control up to 5 characters to collect resources, kill monsters and level up your characters.

The website: https://www.artifactsmmo.com/

This package implements the Artifacts MMO APIs.
I'm using this package as a laboratory to test package development.

Feel free to give feedback!

There is another package with the same purpose:
https://github.com/regenvanwalbeek/artifacts_mmo_openapi

## Features

Considering that every function that doesn't appear in this list is not implemented
